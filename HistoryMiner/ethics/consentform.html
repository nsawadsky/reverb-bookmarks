<h1>Consent Form</h1>
<h1>Revisitation of Code-Related Web Pages by Software Developers</h1>
<p><span class=header>Principal Investigator:</span> Dr. Gail Murphy, Dept of Computer Science (<a href="mailto:murphy@cs.ubc.ca">murphy@cs.ubc.ca</a>, +1 604 822 5169).</p>
<p><span class=header>Co-Investigator:</span> Mr. Nicholas Sawadsky, Dept. of Computer Science (<a href="mailto:nicks@cs.ubc.ca">nicks@cs.ubc.ca</a>, +1 604 618 2021).  This research is part of Mr. Sawadsky's research towards an M.Sc. degree.  The results of this research will be included in Mr. Sawadsky's M.Sc. thesis, which will be made available to the public in due course.</p>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>The overall purpose of the project is to measure how often software developers return to development-related web pages they have previously visited, and determine which methods they use to find previously-visited pages (e.g. web search, bookmarks, or typing the address).  This study is funded by a gift from Microsoft Corporation.<p>
<h2>Study Procedures:</h2>
<p>For the study, you will be asked to download and run a tool on your computer.  The tool will extract a list of web pages visited from your web browser's history database.  The tool will attempt to download each page in this list and classify it as development-related or non-development-related.  Visits to well-known search engines, such as Google and Bing, will also be assigned to a separate category, but search keywords will not be recorded.</p>

<p>To assess classification accuracy, a random sample of the pages classified as development-related will be presented to you.  You will be asked to indicate whether each page was categorized correctly.</p>

<p>Finally, a report will be generated.  In this report, no details which might allow a specific web page to be identified (such as the page address or title) will be included.  For each page visit, the report will include a numeric page identifier, the time of the visit, the method used to access the page (e.g. a bookmark or a link from another page), and the page classification (development-related, non-development-related, or web search).</p>

<p>You will be given the opportunity to view the report before it is submitted.  At any point prior to submitting the report, you may click Cancel to terminate the tool with no data being submitted or stored on your computer.</p>

<p>The entire session will take no more than 30 minutes.</p>

<h2>Known Risks:</h2>
<p>The only known risk is the loss of time required to run the tool.<p>

<h2>Confidentiality:</h2>
<p>No details which might allow a specific web page to be identified (such as the page address or title) will be included in the report generated by the tool.  This report will be kept confidential.  You will be identified by numbers in any written publications.  All reports collected will be kept in locked rooms, locked filing cabinets, or access-protected by password.<p>

<h2>Contact for information about the study:</h2>
<p>If you have any questions or desire further information with respect to the study, you may contact Dr. Gail Murphy at +1 604 822 5169.</p>

<h2>Contact for concerns about the rights of research subjects:</h2>
