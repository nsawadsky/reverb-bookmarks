# User Study Data #

The tool creates logs of events occurring in the browser and in Eclipse. The logs contain web locations visited in the browser, the recommendations the tool generated, and whether you clicked on a given recommendation. Recommendations are generated and logged even if the Reverb view is not currently open in Eclipse. The logs are fully anonymized: web pages visited and links recommended are encoded as numeric identifiers.  No code or web page details (e.g. page content, URL) can be recovered from these logs.

Periodically, the tool will ask your permission to upload the anonymized logs to a server. You will have the chance to review the contents of these logs prior to upload.

At any time, you can terminate your participation in the study by uninstalling the tool. After 6 hours of active coding have elapsed, you will be invited to provide feedback on your experience using the tool. After this point, you can uninstall the tool, or continue using it with data collection turned off.
