# Indexing Browsing History during Install #

During installation of the indexing service, you have the chance to index your Chrome and Firefox browsing history.  Indexing your history will allow the Eclipse plugin to start providing recommendations based on this history right away.

If you choose to do this, the installer will extract a list of pages visited during the past 3 months.  It will then attempt to download the contents of each page from the web and add it to the index.  The process usually takes 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the number of distinct URL's in your history, and the speed of your internet connection.

Pages which need credentials to be accessed will not be indexed during this process.  No user study data is collected during the initial indexing process.
