# Why Reverb? #

Do you find yourself looking up the same web pages again and again as you learn to use a new API? It might be a particularly good tutorial, some sample code, or the API docs for a couple of key classes that you find yourself going back to.

Reverb minimizes the effort to locate these frequently-visited pages.  It automatically detects connections between the code you are working on and web pages you've looked at before, and displays a set of dynamic bookmarks in an Eclipse view.

# How it Works #

Reverb includes browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox, as well as an Eclipse plugin.  It indexes pages in the background as you visit them.  Then as you are viewing or editing  code in Eclipse, Reverb constructs queries using code elements such as class names and method names, and displays the results in an Eclipse view.  Results are ranked by their relevance to your current code, as well as how frequently and recently you have visited the web page.  Results that relate to each other (e.g. they refer to the same API) are automatically grouped together.

# User Study #

The user study is now closed, but you can still download the tool here:

You will be prompted to upload usage data -- you can ignore these prompts. If you do agree to upload the data, the upload will likely display an error.

The results of the user study are described in our research paper, available for download here:
